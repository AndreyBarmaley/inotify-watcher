   inotify events
       The inotify_add_watch(2) mask argument and the mask field of the inotify_event structure returned when read(2)ing an inotify  file  descriptor
       are  both  bit masks identifying inotify events.  The following bits can be specified in mask when calling inotify_add_watch(2) and may be re‐
       turned in the mask field returned by read(2):

           IN_ACCESS (+)
                  File was accessed (e.g., read(2), execve(2)).

           IN_ATTRIB (*)
                  Metadata changed—for example, permissions (e.g., chmod(2)), timestamps (e.g.,  utimensat(2)),  extended  attributes  (setxattr(2)),
                  link count (since Linux 2.6.25; e.g., for the target of link(2) and for unlink(2)), and user/group ID (e.g., chown(2)).

           IN_CLOSE_WRITE (+)
                  File opened for writing was closed.

           IN_CLOSE_NOWRITE (*)
                  File or directory not opened for writing was closed.

           IN_CREATE (+)
                  File/directory  created  in  watched  directory  (e.g.,  open(2)  O_CREAT,  mkdir(2), link(2), symlink(2), bind(2) on a UNIX domain
                  socket).

           IN_DELETE (+)
                  File/directory deleted from watched directory.

           IN_DELETE_SELF
                  Watched file/directory was itself deleted.  (This event also occurs if an object is moved to another filesystem, since mv(1) in ef‐
                  fect  copies  the file to the other filesystem and then deletes it from the original filesystem.)  In addition, an IN_IGNORED event
                  will subsequently be generated for the watch descriptor.

           IN_MODIFY (+)
                  File was modified (e.g., write(2), truncate(2)).

           IN_MOVE_SELF
                  Watched file/directory was itself moved.

           IN_MOVED_FROM (+)
                  Generated for the directory containing the old filename when a file is renamed.

                  IN_MOVED_TO (+)
                  Generated for the directory containing the new filename when a file is renamed.

           IN_OPEN (*)
                  File or directory was opened.

       Inotify monitoring is inode-based: when monitoring a file (but not when monitoring the directory containing a file), an event can be generated
       for activity on any link to the file (in the same or a different directory).

       When monitoring a directory:

       •  the events marked above with an asterisk (*) can occur both for the directory itself and for objects inside the directory; and

       •  the events marked with a plus sign (+) occur only for objects inside the directory (not for the directory itself).

       Note:  when  monitoring  a directory, events are not generated for the files inside the directory when the events are performed via a pathname
       (i.e., a link) that lies outside the monitored directory.

       When events are generated for objects inside a watched directory, the name field in the returned inotify_event structure identifies  the  name
       of the file within the directory.

       The  IN_ALL_EVENTS  macro  is defined as a bit mask of all of the above events.  This macro can be used as the mask argument when calling ino‐
       tify_add_watch(2).
